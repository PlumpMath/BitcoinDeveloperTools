# Bitcoin Developer Tools
This app is intended for Blockchain/Crypto developers to test how to code sending transactions and querying the Blockchain for transactions. 

You can send Main or TestNet coins but I STRONGLY advise to only work with TestNet coins for now as I have not tested sending Main coins yet.

I will not be able to assist with any lost coins as this is for testing purposes only so please just use TestNet Coins.

You can query both Main and TestNet Transaction IDs.

Please provide feedback or pull requests! :)
